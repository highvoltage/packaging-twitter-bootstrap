License: Clarification needed
 FIXME License is unclear, according to the documentation itself it
 is licensed  under CC BY 3.0, but Twitter probably isn't intending
 to release the twitter logo and bird icon under the CC BY 3.0.
 It's also unclear whether the examples are actually CC BY 3.0
 (which ir probably is) or  under the Apache 2 license. This will
 be cleared with upstream before  this package is released, please
 tread carefully.
